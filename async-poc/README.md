# Async in Java
Playground for learning about async features in Java:
    * CompletionStage (interface)

## Some notes
* The `Future` interface was added in Java 5: it provides a reference to its result that will be 
available when the computation itself is completed.
    - Future has several limitations: combining results of several async computations, waiting 
    for the completion of all of them, only waiting for the quickest one, programmatically 
    completing a Future, etc.
* In Java 8, the `CompletableFuture` class was introduced
    - It implements both Future` and `CompletableStage`
    - `supplyAsync()` get a Supplier which will be run by one of the Executors in the 
    ForkJoinPool (but you can pass a different one)
    - You can parallelize in 2 different ways:
        - Parallel streams + map: more efficient when doing compuation-heavy operations with no 
        I/O (if all threads are compute-bound, then there's no point in having more threads than 
        processor cores)
        - Streams + ComputableFuture: better when your parallel units of work involve waiting for
         I/O (including network connections). CompletableFuture gives more flexibility to match 
         the number of threads to the wait/computer. Plus, the laziness of streams can make it 
         harder to reason about when the waits actually happen.
     - `thenCompose()`: pipeline two asynchronous operations. It executes the task in the same 
     Thread than the previous task.
     - `thenCompseAsync()`: it executes the task in a different Thread than the previous task, it
      submits the task to the thread pool (each task can be handled by a different thread).
     - `join()` to wait for all the async tasks to complete. The CompletableFuture.join() method is similar to the get method, but it throws an unchecked exception in case the Future does not complete normally. This makes it possible to use it as a method reference in the Stream.map() method.
     - `thenCombine()`: to combine two independent async calculations. It also exists a 
     `thenCombineAsync()` version.
     - `thenApply()`: register an action to each CompletableFuture; this action consumes the 
     value of the CompletableFuture as soon as it completes and returns CompletableFuture<U>
     - `thenApply()` takes any function and returns whatever value. The difference with 
     `thenCompose()` is that the latter is a function that returns a CompletableFuture<U> 
     - If the idea is to chain CompletableFuture methods then itâ€™s better to use thenCompose().
     - `thenAccept()` is like thenApply(), but it returns a CompletableFuture<Void>
     - `anyOf()`: wait for the completion of only one of the CompletableFutures. E.g. you ask two different services for 
     the same thing, and you just keep the first one that answers.
     - The `exceptionally()` callback gives you a chance to recover from errors generated from the original Future. You can log the exception here and return a default value.
* `CompletableStage
    - defines the contract for an asynchronous computation step that can be combined with other steps.
* Static methods `runAsync()` and `supplyAsync()` allow us to create a CompletableFuture instance
 out of Runnable and Supplier functional types correspondingly.
* The `Supplier` interface is a generic functional interface with a single method that has no arguments and returns a value of a parameterized type.
* Async API: common for I/O systems programming.


## Doubts
* Apollo, Executors and async Java...
